# UNO CARD GAME

Implementation of the board game [**UNO**](https://shopping.mattel.com/it-it/collections/uno).<br>
This project allows the famous game to be played on a single PC using a Textual User Interface (TUI).<br>

## Features

Number of players: between 2 and 5.
Compared to the official game, the following changes have been made:
+ The card to block the next player's turn was not implemented.
+ The card to change the direction of the game was not implemented.
+ The +2 card has an additional effect compared to the official game: besides letting the next player draw two cards, it also blocks his turn.
+ The +4 jolly card (which allows you to change colour and make the next player draw four cards) has not been implemented. 
+ There is, however, a jolly card for changing colours, but without drawing cards.
